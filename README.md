# TheCube
This is a small project I worked on during my studies at Full Sail University.

The program is simply a 3d render of a wiremesh cube. I wrote the code that draws the lines, handles the camera (including the position and fact that it is a perspective camera), and draws/moves the cube.
I utilized vector and matrix mathematics applied to the objects' Transform Matrix in order to achieve the presented effects.
